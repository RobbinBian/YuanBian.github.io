Hi! I am Yuan Bian (ËæπÁºò), a Master student at Xiamen University, China. I study compact dwarf galaxies, bursty star formation, environmental effects, the baryon cycle, stellar feedback and the relations among them using cosmological simulations and semi-analytical models. Specifically, I am interested in the topics of galaxy chemical evolution, galaxy formation history, extreme galaxies, and the nature of dark matter. Although I spend most of my time focusing on theoretical work, I also pay attention to observational data and sometimes combine them with simulations.

I graduated with honors from Tianjin Normal University, advised by Dr. Lizhi Xie. During my master‚Äôs program, I worked with Dr. Min Du and collaborated with Prof. Victor P. Debattista and Dr. Mark A. Norris from the University of Central Lancashire, as well as Dr. Dylan Nelson from the University of Heidelberg closely.

<!-- I won the National Astronomical Observatory of China Scholarship (1000 candidates in China each year) and ByteDance Scholars Program (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of the top 100 AI Chinese new stars and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). -->

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

**Two Channels of Metal-Rich Compact Stellar System Formation: Starbursts Under High Ram Pressure vs. Tidal Stripping**

**Yuan Bian**, Min Du, Victor P. Debattista, Dylan Nelson, Mark A. Norris, Luis C. Ho, Renyue Cen, et al.

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- It addresses and resolves the longstanding question of how outliers in the metallicity-stellar mass scaling relation can attain such high metallicity for their mass.
- It challenges the prevailing assumption that metal-rich Compact Stellar Systems (CSSs) are primarily formed through tidal stripping. We provide a clear understanding of how the recently identified mechanism of ram pressure confinement enriches galaxies within a cosmological framework, particularly highlighting its role in rapid metal enrichment.
- It provides evidence that M32 and similar systems are more likely to have formed through intense star formation rather than gradual tidal stripping. We offer a realistic and testable model that explains the formation and properties of the M31-M32 system, aligning with observed characteristics such as the tidal debris around M31.
